      <h2>10 Stress Management Tips</h2>
      <h5>Zen Zone Article; July 24, 2019</h5>
      <div> <center><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516534775068-ba3e7458af70?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1500&q=80" class="management"></center> </img></div>
      <h3>Tips to manage stressful situations</h3>
      <p>
      It might surprise you to learn that biological stress is a fairly recent discovery. It wasn't until the late 1950s that endocrinologist Hans Selye first identified and documented stress.

      Symptoms of stress existed long before Selye, but his discoveries led to new research that has helped millions cope with stress. We have compiled a list of the top 10 ways to relieve stress.

      <h4>Listen to music</h4>
      If you're feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try taking a break and listening to relaxing music. Playing calm music has a positive effect on the brain and body, can lower blood pressure, and reduce cortisol, a hormone linked to stress.

      We recommend cello master Yo-Yo Ma playing Bach, but if classical really is not your thing, try listening to ocean or nature sounds. It may sound cheesy, but they have similar relaxing effects to music.

      <h4>Talk it out with a friend</h4>
      When you are feeling stressed, take a break to call a friend and talk about your problems. Good relationships with friends and loved ones are important to any healthy lifestyle.

      They are especially important when you are under a lot of stress. A reassuring voice, even for a minute, can put everything in perspective.

      <h4>Talk yourself through it</h4>

      Sometimes calling a friend is not an option. If this is the case, talking calmly to yourself can be the next best thing.

      Do not worry about seeming crazy: just tell yourself why you're stressed out, what you have to do to complete the task at hand, and most importantly, that everything will be okay.
      <h4>Eat right</h4>
      Stress levels and a proper diet are closely related. When we are overwhelmed, we often forget to eat well and resort to using sugary, fatty snack foods as a pick-me-up.

      Try to avoid sugary snacks and plan ahead. Fruits and vegetables are always good, and fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the symptoms of stress. A tuna sandwich really is brain food.
      <h4>Laugh it off</h4>
      Laughter releases endorphins that improve mood and decrease levels of the stress-causing hormones cortisol and adrenaline. Laughing tricks your nervous system into making you happy.

      Our suggestion: watch some classic Monty Python skits like The Ministry of Silly Walks. Those Brits are so hilarious, you will soon be cracking up, rather than cracking up.
      <h4>Drink tea</h4>
      A large dose of caffeine causes a short-term spike in blood pressure. It may also cause your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to go into overdrive.

      Instead of coffee or energy drinks, try green tea. It has less than half the caffeine of coffee and contains healthy antioxidants, as well as theanine, an amino acid that has a calming effect on the nervous system.

      <h4>Be mindful</h4>
      Most of the tips we have suggested provide immediate relief, but there are also many lifestyle changes that can be more effective in the long run. The concept of mindfulness is a large part of meditative and somatic approaches to mental health and has become popular recently.

      From yoga and tai chi to meditation and Pilates, these systems of mindfulness incorporate physical and mental exercises that prevent stress from becoming a problem. Try joining a class.

      <h4>Exercise (even for a minute)</h4>
      Exercise does not necessarily mean power lifting at the gym or training for a marathon. A short walk around the office or simply standing up to stretch during a break at work can offer immediate relief in a stressful situation.

      Getting your blood moving releases endorphins and can improve your mood almost instantaneously.

      <h4>Sleep better</h4>
      Everyone knows stress can cause you to lose sleep. Unfortunately, lack of sleep is also a key cause of stress. This vicious cycle causes the brain and body to get out of whack and only gets worse with time.

      Make sure to get the doctor-recommended seven to eight hours of sleep. Turn the TV off earlier, dim the lights, and give yourself time to relax before going to bed. It may be the most effective stress buster on our list.
      <h4>Breathe easy</h4>
      The advice take a deep breath may seem like a cliche, but it holds true when it comes to stress. For centuries, Buddhist monks have been conscious of deliberate breathing during meditation.

      For an easy three- to five-minute exercise, sit up in your chair with your feet flat on the floor and hands on top of your knees. Breathe in and out slowly and deeply, concentrating on your lungs as they expand fully in your chest.

      While shallow breathing causes stress, deep breathing oxygenates your blood, helps center your body, and clears your mind.

      <h4>Learn more about stress relief</h4>
      Stress is an unavoidable part of life, but that does not mean you should ignore it. Too much untreated stress can cause potentially serious physical and mental health problems.

      The good news is that in many cases, stress is manageable. With some patience and a few useful strategies, you can reduce your stress, whether it's family stress or stress at the workplace.

      <h2>Using Stress as a Motivator</h2>

      <h3>4 Ways Stress Makes You More Productive</h3>
      <p>
      Stress is never helpful in life. Or is it?

      In some cases, stress can motivate you to get something done in ways that were not possible when you were just sipping coffee at a roadside cafe or shooting the breeze on a beach somewhere. Stress happens when we lose control of a given situation, but it can also help us fight back and regain control, which is then motivating and helpful.

      It's important to put stress in a box. Why is it happening? How can you fight it? What needs to change so you are not stressed anymore? What role can you play in reducing the stress? The fact that you are even interested in answering those question is a good sign. When you get stressed, it's a good idea to remember a few less obvious benefits as a way to push you into a higher level of productivity (and thinking).

      <h4>1. It makes you more alert</h4>
      The number one reason stress can be a useful motivator has to do with your increased sense of urgency. You become more aware of the situation, even if that "situation" is a traffic jam or a tense conflict with a co-worker. Learning to manage stress is important, and it's not a good way to live, but that keen awareness is a benefit if it means you are looking more closely at body language during a conflict, quickly scanning through sites that provide practical tips, or seeking out a mentor with helpful advice. Suddenly, you are on the fast lane to find answers. Stress is not fun, but if it leads to a positive outcome, it can be worth the pain.

      <h4>2. It shows you care about the topic</h4>
      Next time you are about to give a presentation to a group of investors or board a plane in a major snowstorm, consider this simple fact: Stress is a sign that you care about the outcome. I tend to get the most stressed about family issues, which is a good sign--it means I really care about my family. It's when you do not get stressed about a change in plans or a conflict that you should wonder why you are not stressed. When you do care, let that extra energy motivate you and make you work harder.

      <h4>3. It teaches you to enjoy the times when you are not stressed</h4>
      Stress, like hunger or a low number in your bank account or even a problem in a relationship, is always temporary (with apologies to those who work in the air traffic control or fire and rescue fields. Or anyone who works with Larry in accounting.) There is an answer. You will get through the problem, even if it takes time. Stress puts you into a mild form of shock and triggers a higher level of alertness, but it will pass. When you are on a hammock in Acapulco next week, relish the time of no stress.

      <h4>4. It helps you find a quick solution</h4>
      No one likes to live with stress on a constant basis. If you've ever missed a flight, you know how much a change in plans can motivate you to find another route home. That same sense of resolving something can work in your favor in business because you suddenly become much more interested in finding the right answer. I'm not saying you should create stress or look for it, but when it happens, consider the fact that you now have a slight advantage. You can be much more productive when you are stressed than the times when you are totally relaxed.

      Those who learn to cope with stress and see how it can serve as a springboard at times will get a burst of productivity.
